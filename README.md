# Part-II-Electrodynamics
Course notes on Electrodynamics I wrote in my third year of university.

These notes are meant to supplement lectured material and should not be used as an alternate to lectures.
It is unlikely that they cover all topics, since the course tends to change from year to year.
Any errors will be mine, please contact me if you discover any
